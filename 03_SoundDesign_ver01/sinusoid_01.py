# Complete explanation is in this article: https://python.plainenglish.io/making-a-synth-with-python-oscillators-2cb8e68e9c3b

# In case of a synth application, we donâ€™t want to generate all the samples at once (we want generating samples as key being pressed for example) 
# When next is called to the generator next sample is generated and put into the array of samples

# This method takes longer than the normal np.sin() method generating samples for lets say 2 second, but it seems necessary for creating a synthesizer app rather than a sound design tool

# Later we see in action how this will help to run a synthesizer
