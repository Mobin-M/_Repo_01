## ## ## ## ## PLAN: 
- Make an exe file/Console app , reading sinusoid, playing it for a time T_sec, plotting it. refresh it when sinusoid properties changed.
- Plot the frequency plot using both the understanding of the frequency existed and then using the Fourier transform (DFT/FFT)
- Plot also spectogram as well for whole period
- Add a "parametric, modifiable, creative" ADSR to it. and re-Do all the above (specially spectogram) for the enveloped note. plot adsr alone as well.
    



## ## ## ## STATE OF PLAM 
- DONE -- Need to do a short OOP course in python to be able to understand PyQt5 
- Understanding asynchronous programming used for concurrent programming
- Asynchio to make the final version of the console app
- Learn about ADSR and it's method









## ## ## Idea for the next step
* Make a GUI using PyQt5 with the same funcionality of the console app
* Adding another frequency to the existing one while still playing. Update the plots


## ## to-do Ideas list (ADD as you wish)
* learn about harmonics and implement functionality to the software to add harmonics to the fundamental frequency. experimenting with new sounds

* how to generate different wave forms? sawtooth,...

* how it is to replicate a instrument (Analyze also Freesounds wav) and how to deviate from it

* Different effect to use on the sound and what else can be done. Reverb, filters, ...

* make an interface to work easier with these sounds

* make a sound using concept of perfect/exponential growth in mind (e) : maybe as a subset of ADSR (Amplitude of one sound) or increasing frequency 

* extending to Android NDK. Does it make sence? Better with C or C++?

* Does it make sense to move from python to Javascript framework?
