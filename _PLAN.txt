## ## ## ## ## ## PLAN: 
Make an Console app, playing plotting analyzing sinusoids with one sinusoid existing at a time:
    - Getting only ONE sinusoid (frequency and Amplitude and phase)
    - playing it for T_sec 
    - let the T second finish before getting a new input
    - Make the Plots:
      -do plots when finished playing
        - the sinusoid
        - Plot the frequency plot using both the understanding of the frequency existed and then using the Fourier transform (DFT/FFT)
        - Plot also spectogram as well for whole period (eventhough it is just one frequency)
    




## ## ## ## ## NOTES
- How is it possible to play a sound continuously. generating a sinusoid/wav file for infinite time...
  1) either we have to generate while playing and remove the previously generated data in order to not finish memory!
  2) cut at a period and make a loop
  3) any other way??

- How to add a note to previously playing sound (for later stages):
  think of a scenario that a note is already being played (for T_sec for example and with/out ADSR). and you want to add another note/frequency to it while playing so that the original note finishes at T_sec and the new note continues for T2_sec...how is it possible?
  First thing is that the input function should always be available. How? thread,async,parallel,..?



## ## ## ## ## STATE OF PLAN 
- Understanding asynchronous programming used for concurrent programming
- Asynchio to make the final version of the console app
- Learn about ADSR and it's method




## ## ## next steps/ideas
* Add a "parametric, modifiable, creative" ADSR to it. and re-Do all the above (specially spectogram to see if new freq pop up?) for the envelop.  ---- ADSR like PID Controller!!!! -- maybe both/either on frequency or amplitude!!! Plot the ADSR alone as well.

* Frequency growth of a sound/sinusoid with exponentional rate. comparison with linear and ...

* ADSR with changing frequency : adding Harmonics

* Adding another frequency to the existing one, (combining together) while still playing. Update the plots

* the input function can be replaced by assigning frequencoes to keyboard button.

* learn about harmonics and implement functionality to the software to add harmonics to the fundamental frequency. experimenting with new sounds

* how to generate different wave forms? sawtooth,...

* how it is to replicate a instrument (Analyze also Freesounds wav) and how to deviate from it

* Different effect to use on the sound and what else can be done. Reverb, filters, ... (after having multiple frequencies or maybe just with one note)

* make an interface to work easier with these sounds

* make a sound using concept of perfect/exponential growth in mind (e) : maybe as a subset of ADSR (Amplitude of one sound) or increasing frequency 

* extending to Android NDK. Does it make sence? Better with C or C++?

* Does it make sense to move from python to Javascript framework?

* Make a GUI using PyQt5 with the same funcionality of the console app
