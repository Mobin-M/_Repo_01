## IDEAS

focus on sound design on python
not to make a working playable synthesizer but to make the elements and experiment with thm.
like:
making simple sinusoids/beats
making advanced complicated sounds,/beats, harmonics,..
filtering, modifying
ADSR
how to sample sound, analyze and work on them, modify them, combine them,...
finally making full range/octave of great sound designs to later use them in production






## SNAP SPECIFIC IDEAS
#
imagine an adsr:
reacing the set amplitude of the sinusoid with a pid like controller 
and at the same time reaching the set frequency of the sinusoid with a pid controller
